Following common advice to manage your own bitcoin and after trying to start bitcoin ventures I needed: 

# A series of steps and materials for secure self-storage of bitcoin

The design is based on 2 principles:
- your private key hard copy, if destroyed, is the last place where it will ever occur in all of conceivable time and space
- achieve with as little dependencies as possible other than bitcoin and linux source code

## Steps of process
1. Offline Delete Drives Securely
2. Offline Setup Transfer and Backup Drives
3. Online setup OS and configure server, with offline bitcoin installation

From here on can transfer to air-gapped computer

4. Offline Create Keys

It is possible to browse transactions from an online full node and copy them by hand, as well as addressess etc. Signed transaction hex is very long and tedious. Depending on security criticality the transfer drive can be used as clipboard between online full node and air-gapped node.

5. Offline Transaction Create and Sign

5.1 (optional backup and checksum)

6. Offline delete Drives Securely

At this point the keys have never touched the internet and are securely destroyed from source computer by programs, or physical destruction as the extreme option. 
The keys thus only exist on your hard copy(ies) of it!!

!!No force in the universe will get this key back to you ever.!!

7. Transfer of signed transaction from offline to online through transfer drive
8. Online Verify Transactions
9. Online Send Signed Transaction
